    <h1>CISW304 - Summer 2022</h1>
    <h2>Avi Sternlieb</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        I'm graduating from a four-year school, missing just a few credits which I'm finishing up this summer.
        We didn't do much web dev though, so I never formally took a class in CSS.
        I studied math & computer science, and really loved it.
        I'm interested in programming languages, and below you'll find a list of some languages I've enjoyed messing around with.
        <br><br>
        I loved abstract algebra. That was my favorite class, by far. I also led a category theory book group online last year. Between the notation and abstraction, there are some common threads between that kind of math and programming language theory.
        I was really excited to work on interpreters and compilers, but I have so many ideas for webapps I want to make, that I've decided to take a more pragmatic, and less academic route.
        <br><br>
        I'd like to work at a company developing webapp prototypes & MVPs for startups. I find the idea of rapid iteration and building new things from the ground up every few months very exciting.
        There's a lot to learn in the webdev world, and that seems like a stimulating environment to learn it in.
        <br><br>
        Plus, I'll learn how to efficiently bring all my webapp ideas to life!
    </p>
